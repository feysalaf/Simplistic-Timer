# Simplistic-Timer

This project contains two timers:

* Simplistic Timer

* Red Circle Timer

Both timers have different aesthetic styles. They are meant to be used as a component in other angular projects. 

## Usage

In order to use the timers simply import them in an angular component. The selectors for the timers are `app-simplistic-timer` and `app-red-circle-timer`. 

```
<app-simplistic-timer minutes="0" seconds="14"  >
</app-simplistic-timer>
```
